Remember, always think of what the base case will look like. In this case, we have a base case of n =0 (Note, you could have also designed the cut off to be 1).\n\nIn this case, we have: n + (n-1) + (n-2) + .... + 0\n\nFill out a sample solution:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def rec_sum(n):\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    else:\n        return n + rec_sum(n - 1)\n    \n    pass","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rec_sum(4)","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":2,"data":{"text/plain":"10"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.11","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
